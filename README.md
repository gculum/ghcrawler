## Troubleshooting & FAQ
In case of querying API intensively there might be a case that API calls are suspended for some time for the incoming IP. This can be verified by issuing
request https://api.github.com/users/<USER-NAME>/repos within a web browser or curl. Be sure to replace <USER-NAME> with legitimate Github login string
